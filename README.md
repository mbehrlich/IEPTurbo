# IEPTurbo

This is eventually going to be a single page web app that allows teachers to design and manage Individual Education Programs,
focusing on implementing a testing feature that would automatically write goals and progress reports on students with disabilities.
IEPTurbo is programmed using the MEAN stack, MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.
